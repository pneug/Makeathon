# Makeathon

This app helps local farmers to detect diseases of plants in their fields. The current implementation is for detecting Fitoftora, Monilia among healthy (Sana) plants. 

## Installation

The project is currently split into two parts, the detection of cocoa bean diseases on mobile phones, and the framework around it, also running on mobile. The code for the detection can be found in the cocoa_detection.zip, while the framework is on the "app" branch. For the detection, upload the folder to https://snack.expo.dev/ and run it on there. For the framework, clone the repository, run `npm install` for instalation and then start the app using `npm start`.
